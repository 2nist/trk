# EnviREAment Migration Log

This document records all migration activities performed to modernize, clean, and consolidate the `/envireament/` directory structure in the trk repository.

## Migration Actions Completed

### Directory Structure Organization
- Created clear directory structure with panels/, widgets/, tools/, and archive/ subdirectories
- Ensured all directories follow consistent naming and organization patterns
- Documented the directory structure in the README.md

### Panels Migration
- Moved dataset browser panels from src/ui/legacy/ to /envireament/panels/
  - ui_dataset_browser.lua
  - ui_dataset_browser_cleaned.lua
  - ui_dataset_browser_fixed.lua
  - ui_dataset_browser_v2.lua
- Preserved full legacy code in /envireament/archive/ for reference
- Created new Development Control Center panel (dev_control_center.lua)

### Widgets Migration
- Migrated src/ui/widgets.lua to /envireament/widgets/widgets.lua
  - Enhanced documentation
  - Removed debug print statements
  - Maintained full backward compatibility
- Migrated src/utils/theme_helper.lua to /envireament/widgets/theme_helper.lua
  - Enhanced function documentation
  - Updated path references

### Tools Evaluation
- Reviewed tools in /envireament/tools/ directory
- Key tools identified and preserved:
  - enhanced_virtual_reaper.lua - Core virtual REAPER environment
  - enhanced_test_runner.lua - Test execution framework
  - verify_environment.lua - Environment validation utilities
  - radial_helpers.lua - Support for radial menu functionality
  - reaimgui_demo.lua - ImGui API showcase and documentation

### Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with comprehensive directory structure
- Added detailed usage examples for widgets and theme helper
- Included migration guide section
- Updated path references to reflect new organization

## Items Flagged for Review

### Tool Duplication
- `enhanced_virtual_reaper.lua` exists in both /envireament/tools/ and /src/
  - The tool version is more comprehensive but should be deduplicated
  - Consider making src/ version a lightweight wrapper that imports from tools/

### API Shim Consistency
- Some panels may still be using direct reaper.* API calls instead of shims
  - All panels should be reviewed and updated to use the virtual API shims
  - Check for imports from src/ vs. envireament/tools/

### Widgets Implementation
- Consider migrating more reusable UI components to widgets.lua
- Example candidates found in panels:
  - Search components
  - List views
  - Filter controls

## Next Steps

1. Review tools for further deduplication
2. Ensure consistent use of API shims across all panels
3. Identify and migrate more reusable UI components to widgets
4. Verify that all archive files contain complete original code
5. Update any documentation/comments within code files

## Notes

- All panels now properly access widgets and theme from the /envireament/widgets/ directory
- The Development Control Center provides a central UI for accessing all EnviREAment functionality
- Future UI components should be added to the widgets directory
- Any new panels should follow the established pattern and use the proper requires

## 2025-06-13
- Created `archive/ARCHIVE.md` to document all deprecated, legacy, and non-Lua scripts in `/archive/` and subfolders, with reasons for deprecation and retention policy.
- Added `SOP_LUA_SCRIPT_MAINTENANCE.md` to `/envireament/` with procedures for testing, patching, static analysis, migration, and documentation.
- Updated `/envireament/README.md` to reflect new directory structure and reference `ARCHIVE.md` and SOP.
- Confirmed all files in `/archive/` are properly marked as deprecated, legacy, or non-functional for the current Lua/REAPER environment.
- All migration actions logged here and in `ARCHIVE.md` for traceability.
