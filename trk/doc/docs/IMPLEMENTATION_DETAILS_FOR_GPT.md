# Songbase Implementation Details

This document provides technical details about the implementation of key features in Songbase for reference by developers and for GPT assistance.

## UI Modules

### Section Editor

The section editor (`ui/section_editor.lua`) allows users to create, edit, and organize sections and chords for songs. It now includes a section combining feature that allows merging multiple sections into a single section.

#### Section Combining Implementation

The section combining functionality is implemented through several components:

1. **State Management**: 
   - Uses `state.section_selection` (table of indices) to track which sections are selected for combining
   - Uses `state.combining_mode` (boolean) to track when combining mode is active

2. **UI Implementation**:
   - "Combine Sections" button toggles combining mode
   - When in combining mode, each section displays a checkbox instead of being directly selectable
   - "Confirm Combine" button processes the selected sections
   - Selection count is displayed to guide the user

3. **Combining Logic**:
   - Sorts section indices to maintain original order
   - Creates a new section with a name derived from the selected sections
   - Combines all chords from selected sections
   - Inserts section name markers between combined sections for clarity
   - Inherits beats-per-chord from the first selected section
   - Removes original sections after combination

4. **State Cleanup**:
   - Exits combining mode after operation
   - Clears selection tracking
   - Sets modified flag
   - Selects the newly created section

### Song Browser

Song browser has been optimized to batch load songs to prevent UI freezing.

### Project Manager

Includes defensive fallback implementation for Widgets module.

## Fixes and Optimizations

1. Fixed ImGui parameter types in BeginChild calls (using 1 instead of true)
2. Implemented batch loading for datasets to prevent freezing
3. Added proper error handling for missing dependencies

## Future Enhancements

1. Enhanced section drag-and-drop reordering
2. Additional chord manipulation capabilities
3. Section duplication functionality
