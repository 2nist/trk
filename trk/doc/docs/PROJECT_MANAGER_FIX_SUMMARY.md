# Project Manager Fix Summary

This document provides a summary of the fixes made to resolve the issues with the Songbase REAPER script application, particularly focusing on the `project_manager.lua` file.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bitwise Operation Fixes

The project_manager.lua file was using direct bitwise '|' operators instead of Lua's `bit.bor()` function, which isn't supported in some Lua environments. We replaced all occurrences with the proper bit.bor() function calls:

Original code:
```lua
local flags = reaper.ImGui_WindowFlags_AlwaysAutoResize() | 
             reaper.ImGui_WindowFlags_NoSavedSettings() |
             reaper.ImGui_WindowFlags_NoResize()
```

Fixed code:
```lua
local flags = bit.bor(
  reaper.ImGui_WindowFlags_AlwaysAutoResize(),
  reaper.ImGui_WindowFlags_NoSavedSettings(),
  reaper.ImGui_WindowFlags_NoResize()
)
```

This fix was applied to:
- Dialog flags in the Export Project dialog
- Dialog flags in another dialog
- Table flags for the songs table
- Selectable flags for song items in the list

### 2. Widgets Module 

The `Widgets.divider` function is now properly implemented in both the widgets.lua file and as a fallback in project_manager.lua to ensure compatibility.

```lua
function widgets.divider(ctx, text)
  reaper.ImGui_Separator(ctx)
  if text then
    reaper.ImGui_Text(ctx, text)
    reaper.ImGui_Separator(ctx)
  end
end
```

### 3. Testing Support

Created a dedicated test script (`test_project_manager_fixed.lua`) to verify that the bitwise operations work correctly.

## Remaining Issues

1. There are some lint errors related to function argument counts in the test file. These are expected in the test environment and don't affect the actual functionality.

2. The project_manager.lua file has some references to undefined ImGui functions. This is likely because these functions are defined at runtime by the REAPER API and don't show up in static analysis.

## Integration with Other Fixes

This fix complements the previous fixes:

1. **Section Editor Fixes**: Fixed the ImGui_Combo null termination issue
2. **Section Combining Feature**: Added the ability to combine sections in the section editor
3. **Project Manager Fixes**: Fixed the Widgets.divider function and bitwise operations

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Run the `test_project_manager_fixed.lua` script to verify that the bitwise operations work correctly.

2. Launch the Songbase application and verify that:
   - The project manager UI loads correctly
   - The Export Project dialog works properly
   - The song table displays correctly
   - The selection of songs in the table works as expected

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing the integrated application to ensure all fixes work together properly.
2. Address any new issues that arise during testing.
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling to prevent similar issues in the future.
