# Section Editor Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The section editor was experiencing an error when rendering: "ImGui_Combo: items must be null-terminated"

## Root Cause
The error was occurring in the ImGui_Combo function calls in section_editor.lua. The function was using `table.concat(items, '\0')` to create the items string, but this resulted in a string that had null characters between items but did not end with a null character.

REAPER's ImGui implementation requires that the items string:
1. Has a null character ('\0') after each item 
2. Ends with an additional null character

## Fix Implemented
Updated the ImGui_Combo calls in section_editor.lua to properly null-terminate the strings:

```lua
-- Before:
root_changed, current_root_idx = reaper.ImGui_Combo(ctx, "Root", current_root_idx, table.concat(roots, '\0'), #roots)

-- After:
local root_strings = table.concat(roots, '\0') .. '\0'  -- Add extra null terminator
root_changed, current_root_idx = reaper.ImGui_Combo(ctx, "Root", current_root_idx, root_strings, #roots)
```

The same change was applied to the chord quality combo as well.

## Verification
1. Created test_imgui_combo.lua to verify the string formatting difference
2. Created test_combo_fix.lua to test in actual REAPER environment
3. Test confirmed that the original version was missing the final null terminator
4. The fixed version correctly adds the final null terminator

## Additional Improvements
Also implemented section combining functionality as requested:
1. Added UI to select multiple sections for combining
2. Added logic to merge sections' chord progressions
3. Created documentation for this new feature
