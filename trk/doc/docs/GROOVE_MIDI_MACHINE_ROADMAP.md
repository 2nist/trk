# Groove MIDI Machine (GMM) Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

The Groove MIDI Machine (GMM) is a comprehensive drum pattern management, manipulation, and organization system for REAPER. It leverages the Groove MIDI Dataset to provide thousands of real-world drum patterns organized into modular, reusable components. The GMM is explicitly designed as a **user-guided assistant** rather than a generative music system.

## Design Philosophy: User-Guided Creative Assistant

The GMM is designed as a **creative assistant and organizational tool**, not an AI-driven beat generator or fully automated system. It follows these core principles:

1. **Suggestions, Not Decisions**: The system provides intelligent recommendations but leaves all creative decisions to the user
2. **Musical Context Awareness**: Suggestions are informed by musical context (style, section, tempo) that the user has already established
3. **Human-Centered Design**: The user remains the primary creator and decision-maker throughout the entire workflow
4. **Transparent Logic**: The reasoning behind any suggestion is clearly explained so users understand why patterns are recommended
5. **Progressive Assistance**: Help ranges from basic organization to advanced suggestions based on user preference and explicit user requests
6. **Real-World Patterns**: Uses exclusively human-played patterns from professional drummers rather than generating artificial beats
7. **Pattern Composition, Not Generation**: Focuses on helping users discover, combine and arrange existing patterns rather than creating new ones algorithmically

The goal is to enhance the user's creative workflow by providing intelligent organization, relevant suggestions, and musical insights while keeping the user firmly in control of the creative process. The GMM acts as an assistant that helps reveal possibilities within existing drum patterns that the user might not have discovered otherwise.

## Phase 1: Dataset Breakdown & Tagging

### Dataset Processing

- [x] Basic extraction of full MIDI patterns from Groove MIDI Dataset
- [x] Organization by style, tempo and drummer
- [x] Create master index with basic metadata
- [ ] Split full kit MIDI into individual components:
  - [ ] kick.mid
  - [ ] snare.mid
  - [ ] hihat.mid
  - [ ] perc.mid
  - [ ] fill.mid (with fill detection algorithm)
- [ ] Enhanced metadata extraction:
  - [ ] Subdivision detection (8th, 16th, triplets)
  - [ ] Swing percentage calculation
  - [ ] Hit density metrics
  - [ ] Velocity variance analysis

### Advanced Tagging System

- [ ] Implement comprehensive tagging system:
  - [ ] Style tags: funk, rock, jazz, trap, etc.
  - [ ] Feel tags: tight, laid-back, swung, etc.
  - [ ] Intensity tags: light, medium, hard
  - [ ] Source identification: drummer + pattern section
  - [ ] Technical tags: shuffle, straight, ghost notes, etc.
  - [ ] Song section tags: verse, chorus, bridge, intro, outro, transition
- [ ] Tag visualization in browser interface
- [ ] Multi-tag filtering system

### Song Structure Classification

- [ ] Pattern analysis for song section identification:
  - [ ] Implement Supermaximal Repeats algorithm to identify core patterns
  - [ ] Analyze density, complexity, and energy to classify patterns by suitable song section
  - [ ] Develop Hidden Markov Models for pattern sequence prediction
  - [ ] Create confidence scoring system for section classifications
- [ ] Manual verification and correction interface for algorithmic classifications
- [ ] Pattern comparison tool to identify similar patterns across different styles
- [ ] Song structure templates with recommended pattern types for each section

## Phase 2: Pattern Module & Groove Card System

### Card System Implementation

- [ ] Create card format specification:
  - [ ] groove_kit.card - Full kit patterns with metadata
  - [ ] groove_layer.card - Individual instrument patterns (kick, snare, hat)
  - [ ] fill.card - Fill patterns for end-of-phrase transitions
  - [ ] swing_profile.card - Feel overlays for quantization and velocity

### Component Separation Engine

- [ ] Implement MIDI component extraction:
  - [ ] Intelligent kick pattern extraction
  - [ ] Snare & ghost note identification
  - [ ] Hat pattern isolation with open/closed detection
  - [ ] Percussion element grouping
  - [ ] Fill identification algorithm

### Pattern Storage System

- [ ] Create database for storing:
  - [ ] Component patterns
  - [ ] Tags and metadata
  - [ ] User favorites and ratings
  - [ ] Custom combinations

## User-Guided Assistant Model

The GMM operates as an assistant to the user's creative process, not as an autonomous creator. This approach works as follows:

1. **User-Initiated Actions**: The system waits for specific user requests rather than automatically generating content
2. **Pattern Discovery**: Helps users discover and browse patterns from the library based on their criteria
3. **User Selection**: Users explicitly select patterns they want to use; the system never auto-selects without user input
4. **Contextual Suggestions**: When requested, provides pattern recommendations that complement user-selected music
5. **Decision Support**: Offers information about patterns (such as energy level or section compatibility) to aid user decisions
6. **Manual Refinement**: All suggestions can be modified, combined, or discarded at the user's discretion
7. **User-Controlled Arrangement**: Song structure and pattern placement are determined by the user, with the system offering organization assistance

The GMM never attempts to replace human creativity or make autonomous musical decisions.
