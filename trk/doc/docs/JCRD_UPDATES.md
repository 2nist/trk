# JCRD Format Implementation Updates

## Summary of Changes

We've made several improvements to the JCRD format implementation:

1. **Standardized on JSON Extension**
   - Confirmed that all JCRD files use `.json` extension
   - Updated scripts to consistently use `.json` extension
   - Created documentation explaining the relationship between JCRD format and JSON extension

2. **Updated File Locations**
   - Added McGill SALAMI dataset to the catalog options
   - Created sample files in the McGill JCRD directory
   - Ensured proper validation paths in the `/jcrddatasets/new_jcrd` directory

3. **Added Key Information**
   - Created script to add missing key fields to JCRD files
   - Applied key detection to McGill JCRD files
   - Improved data completeness for validation and analysis

4. **Improved Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive JCRD format documentation in `/docs/JCRD_FORMAT.md`
   - Updated README with directory structure and workflow information
   - Added clear explanation of JCRD to JSON relationship

## Tools Created

1. **copy_salami_to_mcgill.py**
   - Copies sample files from SALAMI dataset to McGill JCRD directory
   - Provides example of working with JCRD files across directories

2. **add_missing_keys.py**
   - Adds key field to JCRD files that are missing it
   - Uses simple chord analysis to determine the most likely key
   - Can be applied to any directory of JCRD files

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance Key Detection**
   - Improve the key detection algorithm with music theory principles
   - Consider using the music21 library for more accurate analysis

2. **Integrate with Existing Tools**
   - Ensure all existing scripts handle the `.json` extension correctly
   - Update any tools that may be looking for `.jcrd` extension

3. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Add more examples of working with JCRD files
   - Create tutorials for common workflows
   - Document the schema in detail with examples

## Usage Tips

1. **Importing Files**
   - Look for `.json` files when importing
   - Verify they follow the JCRD schema structure

2. **Using the Catalog**
   - Select the appropriate directory based on what you're looking for:
     - McGill SALAMI: Original annotated files
     - McGill JCRD: Processed versions of McGill files
     - Validated Files: Files that passed validation
     - Raw Files: Recently converted/imported files

3. **Validation and Export**
   - All validated files will go to the `/jcrddatasets/new_jcrd` directory
   - Export options are available from the catalog tab
   - Preview files before export to check content
